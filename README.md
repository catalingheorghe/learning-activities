# "learning-activities" repository

## Overview

This is not a project, per-se, as more of a collection of various notes, exercises and other things related to my personal self-learning activities.

## Structure

The structure is not yet clearly defined, as it will take shape as it grows. Once a clear direction materializes, it will be documented here.

In any case, if there are things worth mentioning about the setup, objectives etc, README files in subdirectories will also be created.

## Licensing

Everything in this repository is under "The Unlicense", basically not licensed.

## Contributions

As this is only a space for personal learning activities, not a project, contributions do not make sense.
