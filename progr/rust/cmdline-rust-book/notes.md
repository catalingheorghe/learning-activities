### Project structure and basics

```
dir/
  bin/       <-- bin targets (cargo run --bin true)
    true.rs
  src/
    main.rs
  tests/     <-- integration tests
    cli.rs
```

Rustc is the compiler, but cargo can help with creating a project structure,
then building, running, etc.

Cargo.toml holds the project name, version (semantic versioning), and
dependencies, including dev-dependencies.

A project can have multiple binaries, not only the main one - bin/ subfolder,
for example.

To run the tests - `cargo test`. They can run in any order (--test-threads=1 to
stop that). Test functions are marked with `#[test]`.

### General programming

**Testing**

More than the act of testing, the act of designing tests is one of the best bug
preventers known. The thinking that must be done to create a useful test can
discover and eliminate bugs before they are codedâ€”indeed, test-design thinking
can discover and eliminate bugs at every stage in the creation of software,
from conception to specification, to design, coding, and the rest.

(from chapter 1)

Broad categories

 - Inside-out or unit tests - tests for functions
 - Outside-in or integration intest - run as the user might run the program
