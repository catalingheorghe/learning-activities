// A trait can be implemented by structs, enums, closure, functions.
//
// Common derivable traits
//  - Debug - Debug {:?}, Pretty {:#?}
//  - Clone - allows value to be cloned (clone())
//  - Copy  - type will be copied instead of moved
//      a type using heap at all, can't implement Copy
//      Copy is a subtrait of Clone, so you must #[derive(Clone, Copy)]
//
// Implement traits
// must bring Trait into scope (use) - some are in scope (std prelude)
//  - e.g.: Default for your type
//    (specify a value of a field, rest "struct update syntax" - def values)
//  - others: PartialEq / Eq, From / Into
