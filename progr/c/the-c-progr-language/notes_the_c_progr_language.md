# The C Programming Language (second edition)

## Introduction

Great short overview of C, which points out the fact that it is a small language. It does not offer input/output facilities or multithreaded mechanisms. It deals only with fundamental datatypes (and structures, unions), it does not have built-in operators for lists, strings. All of these are provided by the C library, which is also part of the standard.

Best wording about the use of pointers: offer an architecture independent way to do address arithmetics.
