## 1. Shell notes

Default shell offered by most Linux distributions: GNU Project called `bash` - Bourne Again SHell - `sh` was the original Unix shell written by Steve Bourne.

A **terminal emulator** allows you to interact with the shell when using a GUI (ex: gnome-terminal, konsole).

Prompt usually contains *user@machinename cwd*. If the prompt has the last sign a `#`, the session has superuser priviledges.

Some simple commands

 - `date`
 - `cal`
 - `df`
 - `free`

To **end a terminal session**: `exit`, or close the window or `Ctrl-d`.

*Even if there are no terminal emulators running, there are 6 terminal sessions that are always running behind the GUI. They are called "virtual terminals" or "virtual consoles". To access them: `Alt-F1 - Alt-F6` with `Alt-F7` to return to graphical desktop.*
