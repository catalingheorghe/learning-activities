Excellent book about the command line and bash shell scripting, sprinkled with general Linux operation.

As it is an intro book, it does not go into system administration details, but the overview that it offers was way above my expectations. If this is the first book that you read when starting to use a Linux based distribution, you will be more efficient in your work and things will fall in place better once you learn more about GNU/Linux.

The writing style is perfect for a technical book. The author is clearly knowledgeable and passionate.
